# Calculator (Milestone 4)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Step Completed

### Implement the calculate.js module

- I have created a calculate function.

- My Calculate function is accepting 2 parameters (data and buttonName)

- Data object in the parameter contains three properties (total, next, and operation)

- I have created a "buttonOperation" function separately to do all the calculations but in the same module and my calculate method is calling the "buttonOperation" function and passing all the required parameters to it and "buttonOperation" will return the result.


### Implement the operate.js module

- This module is importing the big.js module from the corresponding npm package.

- I have created a function named operate.

- The operate function is accepting num1, num2, and operation as arguments.

- Using the value of the operation argument, operate function is performing a simple math operation.

- I have wrapped the number parameter with Big() to work with big numbers
