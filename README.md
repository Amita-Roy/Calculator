# Calculator (Milestone 4)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Step Completed

### Implement the calculate.js module

- I have created a calculate function.

- My Calculate function is accepting 2 parameters (data and buttonName)

- Data object in the parameter contains three properties (total, next, and operation)

- I have created a "buttonOperation" function separately to do all the calculations but in the same module and my calculate method is calling the "buttonOperation" function and passing all the required parameters to it and "buttonOperation" will return the result.


### Implement the operate.js module

- This module is importing the big.js module from the corresponding npm package.

- I have created a function named operate.

- The operate function is accepting num1, num2, and operation as arguments.

- Using the value of the operation argument, operate function is performing a simple math operation.

- I have wrapped the number parameter with Big() to work with big numbers




### Prerequisites

Node

**Setup**

- Clone this repository with: "git clone git@github.com:Amita-Roy/Calculator.git" using your terminal or command line.

- Change to the project directory by entering cd 'calculator' in the terminal

- Change branch with 'git checkout Milestone4' in the terminal to see the progress for this branch

- Next run npm install to install the necessary dependencies

- Finally run the 'npm run build' and 'npm start' to start the application


### Usage

Start server with:

```
    npm start
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
